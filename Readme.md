# BookStore

Bookstore app using Angular, Express, Node and MongoDB.

<img src="https://github.com/xalkan/bookstore/blob/master/output.gif" />

Making a simple CRUD app on MEAN stack to learn the basics. This app has an angular frontend and node express backend. For connecting with MongoDB, I'm using mongoose package from npm.

The 'client' directory contains the code for angular frontend. Server is just the app.js in root. Database schema is defined in 'models'.

## Build and Run

Clone the repo and cd into it. Fire up a mongodb instance locally.
Install all the dependencies from the package.json by running
```
npm install
```  
Run the server and go to localhost:3000 to see the bookstore
```
node app.js
```
